    button.
-   The initial background gradient on viewing the page for the first time must be (#780206 and #061161).
-   A default list of background colors must be used. (Its referenced below)
-   Once the default colors are exhausted, the background should again change to
    the first gradient on the list.
-   Make use of Javascript ES6
-   The webpage must be a single page
-   Use fontawesome direction icons for the previous and next button
-   The previous button must be located at the far left of the page while the next button must be located at the far right hand side of the page.
